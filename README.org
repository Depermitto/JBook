This command will create a PDF file called =booklet.pdf= in current working directory. For optimal results, use a dual-printing supported printer or see section below.

** Simplex printers

   If you do not have access to a duplex printer, you have to follow the procedure below:

   1) Print odd pages,
   2) Flip, (Unless you have a very exotic printer, a 180° flip along the vertical axis will work)
   3) Print even pages.
